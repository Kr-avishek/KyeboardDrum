I am building a custom keyboard using HTML,CSS,JS.
My takeout to deal with the DOM property and it's manipulation. 
My Key Points by building this project is : How can we add custom attribute in html template and use it according to our requirement, document.querySelector(), document.querySelectorALL(), EventListener('events', callback to perform on event), adding/removing/toggling class to a node using classList, handling transition using event-listeners.
Ignore the CSS since I am focusing on the **pure JS Functionality** only.
